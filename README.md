Flask App Setup

This README provides instructions for setting up and running a Flask web application using Python's package manager (pip).
Prerequisites

    Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the Python official website.

    pip: pip is a package manager for Python. It is usually included with Python. To verify if you have pip installed, open your terminal/command prompt and run:

    bash

    pip --version

    If you don't have pip, you can install pip separately.

Setup

    Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your project's Git repository.

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash

cd project_directory

Replace project_directory with the name of your project directory.

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

bash

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

    bash

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:

bash

    source venv/bin/activate

Install Required Packages: Install the necessary packages for your Flask application. The required packages are typically listed in a requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask App: You can run the Flask app with the following command:

bash

    python app.py

    Your Flask app should now be running locally. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the app.

Usage

    Customize the Flask app by modifying the app.py file and adding your routes, views, and templates.

    For additional configuration, refer to the Flask documentation.
